# This script file is a stub for systems that might want to include
# checks for the account name that is passed to HOD. It will be
# launched by HOD with the account name as an argument. The script
# should return a zero exit code if the account is valid, and a
# non zero exit code otherwise. Any output that the script generates
# would be reported to the user by HOD, in case of a non-zero exit
# code.
#
# By default, the script does nothing and returns a zero exit code.
exit 0
